    <p class="inspiration">
        my understanding of "the metaverse" is a space where your digital footprint is leveraged by the individual/user(aka you own and have full control of your data). The platform the individual chooses to use, provides the tools (front-end) needed to have meaningful interactions with "the algorithm"(back-end). The individual not the platform decides what a meaningful interaction.

    <p class="home">
        this "baked.cloud" space is going to be designed around this idea of the metaverse...it's "the platform"
    </p>

    <p class="earth">
        "the tools" for now are the <a href="music.html">playlist</a> and sounds files from the <a = href="echo.html">echo chamber</a> (which you can download and use)
    </p>

    <p class="self">
        "the algorithm" will be the data sonification scripts (more on this soon)
    </p>


    <p>
        *this is an evolving idea...changes will happen as more gets built out
