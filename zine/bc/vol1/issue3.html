        the holy grail of baking
    </p>

    <p>
      asked chatgpt for a recipe, then followed it, this is what happened
    </p>

    <ul class="home">
        <li>
            <a href="../recipe/croissant.html">croissant</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://theforest.online/">audio documentation</a>
        </li>

        <li>
            <a href="../../../index.html">sources</a>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <b>process</b>
      <br>
      by step 3 it was not looking good the recipe said "Knead the dough on a floured surface until it is smooth and elastic" but it was the exact opposite by the time I got there...rough and tough...but I continued but with half the dough and with half the ingredients...used the other half to make pizza, which surprisingly worked
      <br>
      <b>end</b>
      <br>
      the end product was pretty dense not croissant airy, possible reasons:
      <ul>
        <li>mixed in the flour all at once instead of in stages</li>
        <li>the recipe had too much flour</li>
        <li>should have been rolled thinner in step 12</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
