    <p class="inspiration">"music is my source code" - Virgil Abloh</p>

    <p class="home">it's a universal language. which is why music will be how all recipe information will be stored. the first major project/idea for this will be making a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonification">data sonification</a> tool which will be used to turn recipes into music...each ingredient will be a sound...each technique will make a harmony...each tool will be an instument...together they will make a symphony of flavor and sound.</p>

    <p class="ego">this all sounds abstract and probably does not make much of sense but this is the "idea in mind" part and hope that it will make more sense once it gets to the "actual thing" part. to do that i am going to be using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperCollider">supercollider</a> to make scripts which can read recipe text files and turn them into audio files </p>

    <p class="self">in the mean time we will be vibing out to playlist which i hope you can use to chill out and bake with...it's like a book club but with playlists updated daily... reset at the beginning on the month</p>
