    <p>
        will be turning this into a recipe book over the next couple of weeks...baked goods coming soon for those in Greater Vancouver!
        <br>
        <br>
        the whole thing will be open source because I think it is important to share the process of developing a thing from idea in mind to the actual thing with all the thrown away experiments available for all to learn from
        <br>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>first open sourcing thing is <a href="how.html">how this website was made</a></li>
        </ul>
        <br>
