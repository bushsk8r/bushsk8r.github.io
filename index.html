    <p>
        going to be adding css to this over the weekend but was just hyped to get this up and running...also wanted to start this on my birthday
        <br>
        <br>
        will be turning this into a recipe book over the next couple of weeks...baked goods coming soon for those in Greater Vancouver!
        <br>
        <br>
        the whole thing will be open source because I think it is important to share the process of developing a thing from idea in mind to the actual thing with all the thrown away experiments available for all to learn from
        <br>
        <br>
        Merry Christmas... remember to carry your mask!!! darona is still out there
