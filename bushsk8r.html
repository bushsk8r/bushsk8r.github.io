    <h2>Long Version:</h2>

    <p>
        when I was younger one of my teachers used to make fun of anyone who walked into class with hair that looked uncombed...saying we looked like bushmen in reference to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_people">San People who are indigenous people from Southern Africa</a>...I am Kenyan and don't have any ancestral ties to the San but I liked the idea of being linked to a pre-colonial past through something as simple as not combing my hair...ever since then every chance that I get to keep my hair uncombed I do.
    </p>

    <p>
        also when I was younger I was obsessed with watching skate videos...there was a punk rebellious energy that angsty teenage me resonated with... later fell into the youtube rabbit hole of longboaring documentaries and found the flowy smoothness of a longboard is more my speed...also kept hurting my knees trying to kickflip...I don't think I will every find a feeling as freeing as cruising on a longboard
    </p>

    <p>
        as an extremely introverted black man....a lot of my thought remain in my head...over the years I have found that this is not a health way to live...I needed an outlet that felt safe...bushsk8r is that...it's an alter ego I use to explore and put out ideas which my anxiety normally stops....it's a way I can put my fears and ego aside and channel a flow state letting the purest version of myself create
    </p>

    <p>
        we all need a way to color outside the lines then seeing what magic happens after taking a step back...does not feel right keeping that child like wonder inside
